## Ecosystem Value Flows 
Web3 economies are ecosystems that enable the direct interaction of multiple stakeholders. These interactions are bounded by a predefined action space and propelled by economic and non-economic incentives. The design space for such interactions is huge, ranging from supply and demand side contributions to higher-level value adds (think curation, verification), to governance and decision making, to shared and distributed ownership.  
In this course, you'll learn how to design, keep track of, and optimize such multidimensional ecosystems value flows. This interactive online course picks up where *Business Model Generation* ends. Based on your core ecosystem objectives, we'll drill down to the stocks and flows in your system - a prerequisite to define appropriate economic mechanisms and apply engineering techniques to validate and stress test your system model.

This course is for individuals or project teams who are  
+ in the process of further developing a viable tokenized economy, e.g., based on an initial white paper  
+ looking for tools and a structured process to collaboratively iterate on the system design e.g., with developers, advisors, and the community

The first phase of Ecosystem Value Flow design consists of analyzing and specifying the value network of organizations and individuals. We start with canvases that are familiar to business and platform architects. For the purpose of token engineering design, we adapted these frameworks to help us focus on value flows and motivations as inputs for incentive mechanism design. We'll train to consciously take the macro and micro perspective, and will apply various methods for value flow visualization and specification. Finally, the value network description will be carried out in [Stocks & Flows](https://systemic2016.wordpress.com/system-dynamics-stock-and-flow-modelling/) diagrams.

The course agenda: 
### Part 1: Ecosystem Purpose & Members
The ecosystem's purpose is the shared motivation of all stakeholders. *Stakeholder Profiles* help to document member characteristics, the valuable assets and capabilities they bring to the ecosystem, as well as motivations to share these. 
### Part 2: Stakeholder Interactions & Motives
We collect an overview of relationships and interactions that are naturally given in an ecosystem: intrinsic motivations, systemic incentives. Is the ecosystem balanced? Does it have a positive-sum game? Is there one dominant member? A *natural monopoly*? Next, we take snapshots of situations and interactions, reflect member actions and motivations behind, and note our most significant assumptions. These will be the questions informing the modeling and simulation in later stages of computer-aided design. These assumptions also encompass the action space and constraints to make interactions *safe and fair*.
### Part 3: Games & Governance
We analyze interactions with respect to the desired outcome: Do the members need additional incentives? Can such an incentive be defined as a system policy? Can a policy be automated (algorithmic policies)? Does it require human deliberation (discretionary policies)? And finally: Who decides who decides (governance)?
The ecosystem governance questions based on Elinor Ostrom's help you reflect and collect assumptions. We use an ecosystem game design framework, based on Le Grand Jeu, to facilitate co-creation with stakeholders, and train communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking!
### Part 4: Value Network Specification
>Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple and stupid behavior. - Dee Hock  

On the last day of the course, you will familiarize yourself with an adapted version of Stock & Flow diagrams to map out token networks. Valuable assets and capabilities of members become *stocks* in the system. The interactions and relationships define *flows*. User behavior, actions, and system policies define the dynamics of these flows. First, list the questions that can be answered through simulations in the later stages of computer-aided design. You can start by depicting these excerpts and adding more to one model or create multiple models describing different aspects.

### Where to from here?
This course focuses on specifying ecosystem value flows and communicating them in a visual language appropriate for domain and technical stakeholders.
A token engineer will continue by applying existing Cryptoeconomic Patterns, adapting them, and/or creating new mechanisms, observing the changes in the specification, and discussing these with stakeholders.
In the next stages of Computer-aided Design you or your technical counterpart can further specify the dynamic model using [Differential Specification Syntax](https://community.cadcad.org/t/differential-specification-syntax-key/31) and simulate using [cadCAD](https://cadcad.org/). This process is iterative and aims to make assumptions explicit, stress test, and improve the models.
