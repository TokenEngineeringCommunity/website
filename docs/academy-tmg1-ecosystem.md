## Ecosystem Value Flows 
Web3 economies are ecosystems that enable the direct interaction of multiple stakeholders. These interactions are bounded by a predefined action space and propelled by economic and non-economic incentives. The design space for such interactions is huge, ranging from supply and demand side contributions to higher-level value adds (think curation, verification), to governance and decision making, to shared and distributed ownership.  
In this course, you'll learn how to design, keep track of, and optimize such multidimensional ecosystems value flows. This interactive online course picks up where *Business Model Generation* ends. Based on your core ecosystem objectives, we'll drill down to the stocks and flows in your system - a prerequisite to define appropriate economic mechanisms and apply engineering techniques to validate and stress test your system model.

This course is for individuals or project teams who are  
+ in the process of further developing a viable tokenized economy, e.g., based on an initial white paper  
+ looking for tools and a structured process to collaboratively iterate on the system design e.g., with developers, advisors, and the community  

The first phase of Ecosystem Value Flow design consists of analyzing and specifying the value network of organizations and individuals. We start with canvases that are familiar to business and platform architects. For the purpose of token engineering design, we adapted these frameworks to help us focus on value flows and motivations as inputs for incentive mechanism design. We'll train to consciously take the macro and micro perspective, and will apply various methods for value flow visualization and specification. Finally, the value network description will be carried out in [Stocks & Flows](https://systemic2016.wordpress.com/system-dynamics-stock-and-flow-modelling/) diagrams.

**Course Structure:**  
Module 1: Ecosystem Purpose & Members  
Module 2: Incentives  
Module 3: Games for Token Economy Co-Creation  
Module 4: Value Flows  
Module 5: Governance   

At the end of this course, you will produce an adapted version of Stock & Flow diagrams to map out your token networks. Valuable assets and capabilities of members become *stocks* in the system. The interactions and relationships define *flows*. User behavior, actions, and system policies define the dynamics of these flows. You'll be able to list the questions that need to be answered through simulations in the later stages of computer-aided design. You can start by depicting these excerpts and adding more to one model or create multiple models describing different aspects.

### Where to from here?
This course focuses on specifying ecosystem value flows and communicating them in a visual language appropriate for domain and technical stakeholders.
A token engineer will continue by applying existing Cryptoeconomic Patterns, adapting them, and/or creating new mechanisms, observing the changes in the specification, and discussing these with stakeholders.
In the next stages of Computer-aided Design you or your technical counterpart can further specify the dynamic model using [Differential Specification Syntax](https://community.cadcad.org/t/differential-specification-syntax-key/31) and simulate using [cadCAD](https://cadcad.org/). This process is iterative and aims to make assumptions explicit, stress test, and improve the models.
