## Contribute to comms!
**TE Newsletter**        
Currently, we’re distributing TE news via our Twitter channel @tokenengineering. In the future we’d love to establish a (monthly?/weekly?) newsletter with selected picks on all things tokens.   
Are you interested in being the voice of Token Engineering, providing the best reads for our members? English native speakers and some newsletter experience welcome.  DM us [@tokenengineering](https://twitter.com/tokengineering)! 

**TE Meetups Switzerland**   
Personal growth opportunity for Swiss Token Engineers (non Swiss also no problem but many Swiss speakers appreciate a phonetically correct "Gruezi"; it takes 6 months to imitate well) : @MoritzKaminski and I are growing the Token Engineering Switzerland team and are looking for 1-2 motivated people to help us run the Chapter events.   Benefits: You get to grow a stellar professional network, can shape memorable events, and we always have free booze handy. Contact [@gablerjonathan](https://twitter.com/gablerjonathan) or [@MoritzKaminski](https://twitter.com/MoritzKaminski).
